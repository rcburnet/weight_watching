Here you will find my weight loss journey text files and scripts. 

I started at a weight of around 210 lbs and am aiming for a weight of 160-170 lbs. I'll go for 3-4 days of either eating nothing at all, or eating very little (<1000 calories) until I've reached a weight lower than my previous 3-4 day low calorie period, and then I'll have a feast day where I'd eat normally, and repeat. I take a multivitamin with minerals and fish oil pills everyday to ensure I don't get malnourished, and I have frequent trips to the doctor for checkups to make sure everything is okay.

fasting.txt gives details on what I do during my fast and a bit of background as to why.

weight.txt is a csv file where each line represent a row (new day) that is a new entry for my weight on that day, with a flag that indicates whether or not that is a fast day, as well as the number of calories consumed and burned (using Google Fit), and notes on what I ate that day.

plot.py is a python script for plotting my weight loss journey over time and my weight loss trend (4-day rolling mean).

weight.png is the output plot of the above script.
