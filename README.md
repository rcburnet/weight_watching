Here, you will find my weight loss journey text files and scripts.

fasting.txt gives details on what I do during my fast and a bit of background as to why.

weight.txt is a csv file where each line represent a row (new day) that is a new entry for my weight on that day, with a flag that indicates whether or not that is a fast day, as well as the number of calories consumed, and calories burned (using Google Fit).

plot.py is a python script for plotting my weight loss journey over time and my weight loss trend (4-day rolling mean).

weight.png is the output plot of the above script.
