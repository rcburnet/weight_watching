Do alternate day fasting, 1 day water fast (~36 hours), the next day feast (~ 12 hours) eat up to your TDEE and get a lot of nutrients (vegetables, fruits, meat, any whole foods ie. unprocessed foods).

If doing extended fasts (more than 36 hours), be sure to get enough sodium (5000 mg), magnesium (300 mg), potassium (1000 mg), calcium, and other minerals in your body through supplements and taking himalayan pink salt in water. Also take a multivitamin (without minerals if you are already taking supplements for the minerals) and fish oil pills. You can mix the himalayan pink salt into water.

When coming off a long fast, don't eat junk. You want to regain the lost protein in your organs and muscle. To do that, you need to eat nutrient dense foods (vegetables, fruits, nuts, unprocessed meats).

Fat oxidation (burning) is higher than protein oxidation during fasts (http://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.00559.2009)
